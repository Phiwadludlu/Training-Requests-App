## Description of Business Case:

The management of a company has been encouraging for more training and development amongst
employees within the organization.

**Current Process**
The company currently has a training approval process in place which is as follows:
1. An employee/team leader (requestor) fills in a training booking request form (see below)
2. The document is then emailed to the department manager for approval by the requestor.
3. If the department manager approves of the training, the document will be signed and sent to the
learning and development manager for approval. If rejected, the department manager will email
the requestor and notify them on the reasons. Steps 1 and 2 will take place if the requestor needs
to resubmit.
4. If the learning and development manager approves of the training, the document will be signed
and send to the training coordinator. If rejected, the learning and development manager will email
the requestor and notify them on the reasons. The requestor will need to update document and
resubmit back to the learning and development manager.
5. Finally the training coordinator will make a booking for the training and notify the requestor of the
training details.
